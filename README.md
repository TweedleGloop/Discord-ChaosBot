# Discord-ChaosBot
A discord bot made to cause chaos. Full of messy and bad code because I don't know what I'm doing.

Usage Instructions

Step 1: Install Discord.JS to the directory where you downloaded or cloned this repo to by opening a command prompt there and typing npm install discord.js. You need node.js for this to work

Step 2: Make a token.json file like this 

{
"token":"YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}

Step 3: Run botStart.bat and the bot should be up and running 


To change the Status, Command Prefix or Video thats linked when you click on watch just edit them in config.json


WARNING: USING ANY COMMAND THAT SENDS A LOT OF MESSAGES TOO MUCH IN TOO MANY CHANNELS CAN EASILY GET YOU RATE LIMITED.
 

Also just please don't use this bot in a malicous way. I just made it to test what I can do so please dont harass or damage anyones server in any way.
